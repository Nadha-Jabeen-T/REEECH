# REEECH

An online platform to connect those less privileged but skilled small-scale entrepreneurs/craftsmen/artists etc with the right buyers. Here,buyers can find unique hand-made products they can also connect to the seller to buy customized products according to their wish.We help those people who are not aware of marketing ideas to promote and give reach in the market. In return, if they are benefitted from  our platform, then we will offer them more perks by charging an amount from them. This additional perks include recommending their product to our buyers and include it in top search, enabling customer reviews for their product which encourages more buyers to buy their product.

This project is created as part of Make-a-ton 3.O, an open hackathon conducted by CUSAT
